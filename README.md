# Transition Property

## Courework
### The transition property allows you to trigger a style change to a HTML element
 
 1st example: Green box 50px by 50px expands width to 150px when hovered.
 Then, adjusted duration to 2s.
 
 2nd example: When un-hovered the transition disappears in a jerky manner. 
 By moving the transition property to the original elements style code, the transition will gradually disappears.
 
 3rd example: Lets play with colors! Just add the color to the transition-property.
 --transition-property: width, background-color;-- 
 CSS gradually changes the color through the color spectrum as well!
